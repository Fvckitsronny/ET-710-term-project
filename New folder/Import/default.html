      <p>Import cars are technically what you might have been guessing all along. 
      Yes they are cars that have ben import from different places around the world. For example their are many cars imported from Japan. They consist of Nissan, Honda, Toyota, etc. 
      Their are also German cars, etc. When a car is imported from a different part around the world, they must meet or have met the criteria to be accepted into the country. 
      Many cars must pass different variety of emissions and controls tests and other tests. 
      When these cars pass these tests, they are then accepted to be placed and import to the USA or another part of the world. Imported motor vehicles are subject to safety standards under the Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, revised under the Imported Vehicle Safety Compliance Act of 1988; to bumper standards under the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act of 1972, which became effective in 1978; and to air pollution control standards under the Clean Air Act of 1968, as amended in 1977, and 1990.

If vehicles manufactured abroad conform to U.S. safety, bumper, and emission standards, it is because these vehicles are exported for sale in the United States. Therefore, it is unlikely that a vehicle obtained abroad meets all relevant standards. Be skeptical of claims by a foreign dealer or other seller that a vehicle meets these standards or can readily be brought into compliance. Vehicles entering the United States that do not conform with U.S. safety standards must be brought into compliance, exported, or destroyed. <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/trade/basic-import-export/importing-carhttp://www.cbp.gov/trade/basic-import-export/importing-car"> More about Import Cars here</a>
