      <p> A sport utility vehicle or suburban utility vehicle (SUV) is a 
	  vehicle similar to a station wagon or estate car, usually equipped with 
	  four-wheel drive for on- or off-road ability. Some SUVs include the towing 
	  capacity of a pickup truck with the passenger-carrying space of a minivan 
	  or large sedan. The Jeep Cherokee of 1983 and especially the Ford Explorer 
	  of 1990 made SUVs popular for mothers and families in the late 1980s and 
	  early 1990s, despite their reputation as dangerous vehicles&nbsp; (though 
	  minivans have done poorly on safety tests as well). By 1994 SUVs outsold 
	  minivans in the United States. Peaking in the late 1990s and early to mid 2000s, SUVs sales temporarily declined due to high oil prices and a declining economy. The traditional truck-based SUV is gradually being supplanted by the crossover SUV, which uses an automobile platform for lighter weight and better fuel efficiency, as a response to much of the criticism of sport utility vehicles. By 2010, SUV sales around the world were growing, in spite of high gas prices. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_utility_vehiclehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_utility_vehicle">More About SUV's Here</a> </p>
