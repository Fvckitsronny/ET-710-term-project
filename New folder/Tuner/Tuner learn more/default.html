            <p>Tuners are cars that can be modified to included 
			varies high performance upgrades, engine modifications, etc. Car 
			tuning is modification of the performance or appearance of a 
			vehicle. For actual "tuning" in the sense of automobiles or 
			vehicles, see engine tuning. Most vehicles leave the factory set 
			up for an average driver's expectations and conditions. Tuning, 
			on the other hand, has become a way to personalize the 
			characteristics of a vehicle to the owner's preference. Cars may 
			be altered to provide better fuel economy, produce more power, 
			or to provide better handling. Car tuning is related to auto
			racing, although most performance cars never compete. Tuned cars are
			built for the pleasure of owning and driving. Exterior 
			modifications include changing the aerodynamic characteristics 
			of the vehicle via side skirts, front and rear bumpers, 
			spoilers, splitters, air vents and light weight wheels. Cars 
			have always been subject to after-market modification. The 
			golden age of car tuning was the decades between World War II 
			and the beginning of air pollution restrictions. Both moderate
			and radical modification have been commemorated in the popular songs 
			Hot Rod Race and Hot Rod Lincoln. The names of Abarth and Cooper 
			appear on models styled after the cars they modified. Cosworth 
			went, with support from Ford, from modifying English Ford 
			Flathead engines for Lotus Sevens to dominating Formula One. In 
			the 1970s and 80s, many Japanese performance cars were never 
			exported outside the Japanese domestic market. In the late 1980s 
			and early 1990s, grey imports of Japanese performance cars, such 
			as the Nissan Skyline, began to be privately imported into Western 
			Europe and North America. In the United States, this was in direct 
			contrast to the domestic car production around the same time, where 
			there was a very small performance aftermarket for domestic compact 
			and economy cars; the focus was instead on sporty cars such as the 
			Ford Mustang and Chevrolet Corvette, or on classic muscle cars.
			Because of their light weight and the increasing availability of 
			low-cost tuning equipment, economy and compact cars exhibit high 
			performance at a low cost in comparison to dedicated sports cars. As 
			professional sporting and racing with such vehicles increased, so 
			did recreational use of these vehicles. Drivers with little or no 
			automotive, mechanical, or racing experience would modify their 
			vehicles to emulate the more impressive versions of racing vehicles, 
			with mixed results.    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_tuninghttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_tuning">More about Tuners here </p>
